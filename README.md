# Project Proposal

## **While We Were Dreaming**

## What and why?

**While We Were Dreaming** is a location-based, interactive platform that allows students to share, explore, and relive memories on campus by pinning them on a dynamic map. Whether it's the place where they met lifelong friends, discovered their favorite study spot, or experienced a key milestone, students can revisit the emotions and events that defined their college journey.

The problem this system addresses is the lack of connection and community that can arise at an open-city campus like NYU, where students are constantly moving through the city and may feel disconnected from their peers, the campus, and even their own memories. **While We Were Dreaming** offers a digital platform for students to capture and share their personal memories, helping them reflect on the emotional significance of the places they’ve experienced and bridge a gap in student connection.

This is important because it creates a collective memory for the NYU community, preserving both individual and shared histories in a meaningful way. It also fosters connection among students by letting them see what memories others have left in familiar or new locations.

The name, **While We Were Dreaming**, is inspired by the iconic "Dream Until It's Your Reality" graffiti that can be found scattered everywhere among campus and other places in the city that is often one of the first sights that greets students upon their arrival in New York. It resonates with the spirit of NYU, where the city and campus serve as the backdrop for countless dreams – thus, one can say this is a map of all our memories and the things we did here "while we were dreaming".

## For whom?

This app is built for current NYU students navigating campus life and creating personal memories, as well as alumni looking to relive their college experiences through shared moments. It also caters to future students eager to explore the stories and experiences that have shaped the NYU community.

## How?

From an end-user's perspective, **While We Were Dreaming** will offer the following features:

  * __Pin Memories__: Users can drop a pin on the interactive campus map and leave a story, memory, or reflection tied to that location. 

  * __Explore Memory Map__: Users can browse through the map and explore memories shared by other students. 

  * __Guided Prompts__: When users pin a memory, they can optionally choose from a series of prompts to guide their reflection. 

  * __No Likes or Interactions__: Users can view and explore memories but cannot interact through likes or comments. The experience is about discovery, not validation.

  * __Anonymity and Ambiguity__: There are no usernames or profiles. Each pin on the map feels like it’s been left by a ghost from the past, allowing users to explore the memories of others without knowing who pinned them.

  * __Viewing Your Own Journey__: Users can toggle the map to view only the memories they've pinned. Users have the option to delete their pins.

## Scope

**While We Were Dreaming** is appropriately scoped for a team of 4-6 programmers to complete within a semester. The project requires minimal (but well-designed) wireframes and pages on the frontend, allowing the team to focus on the more involved aspect of the backend and of handling geospatial data and queries. Integrating location-based features will provide an interesting and engaging technical challenge while remaining completely feasible within the timeframe.

This approach ensures the team can dedicate time to refining the geospatial functionality without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the overall system.
